Part 1 was relatively easy. It reads the lines into arrays of numbers and then transposes to get the problems. It just joins the numbers in each column (rows after the transpose) and joins them by the last cell before passing the problem to eval to figure out.
Part 2 took me longer to understand. I hadn't appreciated that the whitespace made a difference to the numbers. I started off assuming that they should all just be right justified. Once I understood that space made a difference I attempted to change my parser. I started looking at regex but I couldn't tell the difference between trailing space on the left column vs leading space on the right column. In the end I'm reading each line column by column and building the problem up. If there is a column with all spaces then that's the indicator that it's a new problem.
